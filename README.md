- Data extraction from the web using Python's Beautiful Soup module.
- Data transformation using Python's Pandas library.
- Data visualization using Python's Matplotlib library.
# Data Validation
- Create Assertions - develop assertions based on a listing of all Oregon automobile crashes on the Mt. Hood Hwy (Highway 26) during 2019 as a way to make assumptions explicit. 
- Validate and Evaluate the Assertions - evaluate the assertions and test the assumptions. 
- Learn and Iterate - starting the whole process over again by creating new assertions.
- Resolve the Violations - Helps you to refine your existing assertions.
- Retest- Validate the data again.
# Data Storage
